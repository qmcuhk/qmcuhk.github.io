Prof. Huang is a renowed expert on x-ray spectroscopy study of solid state systems. His team has developed the 41A beamline, which delivers currently the best energy resolution (FWHM ~ 16 meV) at oxygen <i>K</i>-edge (~530 meV) for RIXS. In his talk today, Prof. Huang gave an overview of RIXS instrumentation and applications in different quantum materials. We are truely grateful to Prof. Huang for the inspiring talk and discussions.
