Last week, Qisi attended the 18th National Conference on Superconductivity held in Shanghai and delivered an invited talk. It was a wonderful opportunity to learn about recent advances in superconductivity, both in fundamental mechanisms and practical applications. It was a pleasure connecting with old and new friends. Looking forward to the 2027 NCSC in Beijing!
