Today, our group had the pleasure of hosting Dr. Jaewon Choi, from the <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Magnetic-Materials/I21.html" target="_blank">I21 beamline at Diamond Light Source</a>. Dr. Choi is an expert on scattering, particularly resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). He gave a captivating seminar about his recent research on cuprate and nickelate superconductors. His presentation also highlighted the latest advancements in the RIXS teachnique, rendering it a potent scalpel for investigating quantum materials. We are thankful for Dr. Choi's visit and look forward to our future collaborations.
