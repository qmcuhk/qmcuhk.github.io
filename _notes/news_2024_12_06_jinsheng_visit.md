Today, our group had the pleasure of hosting the Deparmental Colloquium with the keynote speaker <a href="https://neus.nju.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Prof. Jinsheng Wen</a> from Nanjing University. Prof. Wen is a distinguished experimentalist committed to neutron spectroscopy study of strongly correlated systems, including high-Tc superconductors and quantum magnets. In his presentation, Prof. Wen discussed Kitaev physics across different spin systems and showcased his recent research work in this area. We are thankful to Prof. Wen for the inspiring talk.
