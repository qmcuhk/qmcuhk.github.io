This week, the 2024 Joint Annual Conference of Physical Societies in Guangdong-HK-Macao Greater Bay Area (YGA 2024) was held in Macau. Qisi was invited to talk about our recent work on dynamical charge correlations in the cuprates. We enjoyed many inspiring talks and fruitful discussions, which will surely lead to new idea and collaborations.
