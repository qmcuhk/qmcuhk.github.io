Today, we were glad to have Dr. Leonardo Martinelli and Dr. Izabela Biało visiting our group. Leonardo and Izabela are currently postdoctoral researchers at <a href="https://www.physik.uzh.ch/groups/chang/index.php" target="_blank">Laboratory for Quantum Matter Research</a> of the Physik Institut, University of Zürich. Leonardo gave an excellent seminar talk about their recent RIXS studies of spin, orbital, and charge dynamics in the cuprates. It was a great opportunity to learn about some exciting new physics!
