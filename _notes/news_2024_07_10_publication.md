The cuprate phase diagram is characterized by various intertwinned quantum states. Realization of tuning between these phases is important becuase it may offer insights into the coupling mechanism. In a recent hard X-ray diffraction study, we successfully applied uniaxial strain perpendicular to the copper-oxide planes in La<sub>1.88</sub>Sr<sub>0.12</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> and show that <i>c</i>-axis compression enhances stripe order within the superconducting state, while having no impact on the normal state. These results demonstrate <i>c</i>-axis strain as an effective tuning knob of the competing interaction between charge stripe order and superconductivity.
