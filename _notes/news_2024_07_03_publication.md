The newly discovered superconductivity in the infinite-layer nickelates has become a subject of intense interest. It has been shown that the superconducting transition temperature <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> can be increased by 40% for Pr<sub>0.8</sub>Sr<sub>0.2</sub>NiO<sub>2</sub>, when the substrate changes from SrTiO<sub>3</sub> (STO) to (LaAlO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>0.3</sub>(Sr<sub>2</sub>TaAlO<sub>6</sub>)<sub>0.7</sub> (LSAT), which applies compressive strain to the film. To understand the underlying mechanism, we performed resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) studies on the undoped PrNiO<sub>2</sub> films grown on the two different substrates and investigated the strain effect on the magnetic excitations. Our experiments show that the strain-tuning has marginal influence on the magnon bandwidth, in sharp contrast to the enhancement of <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> in the doped films. Since magnetism is one of the candidates to mediate Cooper pairs, this finding provides important implications for elucidating the superconductivity mechanism in infinite-layer nickelates.
