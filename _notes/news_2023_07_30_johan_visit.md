Last days, we are hosting Prof. Johan Chang from the Physik Institut, University of ZÃ¼rich. Johan Chang is the leader of The Laboratory for Quantum Matter Research (LQMR) and President of Swiss Physical Society (SPS). Johan gave a great seminar talk about their recent research on quatum matter using x-rays. Together we discussed exciting opportunities for collaborations. Thanks Johan!
