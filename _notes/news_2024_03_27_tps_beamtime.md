Last week, our team visited <a href="https://tpsbl.nsrrc.org.tw/bd_page.aspx?lang=en&pid=1051&port=41A">41A RIXS beamline</a> at Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) for the second time. With beautifully cleaved single crystals, we obtained amazing dataset. Special thanks to our local contacts Di-Jing, Hsiao-Yu, and Jun. We look forward to come back to see the upgraded beamline next time!
