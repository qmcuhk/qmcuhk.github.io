Last week, our team visited <a href="https://tpsbl.nsrrc.org.tw/bd_page.aspx?lang=en&pid=1051&port=41A">41A RIXS beamline</a> at Taiwan Photon Source. During our beam time, we successfully measured several samples and collected high-quality data â€” all thanks to the dedication and teamwork of everyone involved. We especially appreciate the invaluable support provided by the beamline scientists. A special congratulations goes to Yuetong, Yuehong, and Tianren for completing their first beamtime!<br>
