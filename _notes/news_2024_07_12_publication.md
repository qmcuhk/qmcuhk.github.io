Magnetic frustration can give rise to intriguing ground states like quantum spin liquids and valance bond states. On 2D square lattices with S=1/2 or 1, such frustration can originate from incompatible Heisenberg exchange interaction, i.e., when antiferromagnetic J<sub>2</sub>/J<sub>1</sub>~0.5. Yet, it has been challenging to tune the frustration ratio towards this regime.

In a recent RIXS experiment, we studied spin excitations in spin-1 La<sub>2</sub>NiO<sub>4</sub></b> films grown on various substrates. Modeling of the magnons shows that epitaxy strain acts as an effective tuning of the magnetic frustration in this system. These results offer a new route to explore the physics of frustrated magnetism.
