Last week, our team went to Grenoble for a RIXS beam time at the <a href="https://www.esrf.fr/ID32">ID32 beamline</a> of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The experiment was a great success, yielding spectacular data. We are thankful for the exceptional support from the beamline scientists at ID32, especially our local contact Marli Dos Reis Cantarino. Now it's time to delve into the data and uncover the physics behind.<br>
