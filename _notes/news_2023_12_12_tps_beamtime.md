Our team recently visited Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) at <a href="https://www.nsrrc.org.tw/">NSRRC</a> for the first time and conducted our RIXS experiment at the <a href="https://tpsbl.nsrrc.org.tw/bd_page.aspx?lang=en&pid=1051&port=41A">41A beamline</a>. It is amazing that the state-of-the-art energy resolution can be achieved with such a "short" spectrometer arm. Beautiful dataset has been collected during this beamtime. Many thanks to the beamline staffs and our remote team in Zurich! We are looking forward to coming back in the next spring!
