<p>
We perform x-ray and neutron scattering/spectroscopy experiments at large scale facilities like synchrotrons and neutron resources to study the static and dynamic properties of crystal lattice, electrons, spins and their interactions in condensed matter systems. We also perform in-house x-ray diffraction and transport measurements.

        RIXS employs x-rays that are close to an absorption edge of the sample’s element. It thus involves an intermediate transition from core levels to the unoccupied valence states. The resonance transition greatly enhances the sensitivity of RIXS to electronic correlations. In a RIXS process, the changes of photons’ energy, momentum, and polarization are transferred to the sample generating various elementary excitations such as phonon, magnon, charge excitations, dd-excitations, and plasmon. RIXS has been rapidly developing over the past decades. For soft-RIXS, the state-of-the-art energy resolution has reached ~40 meV with 1 keV x-rays.

        <div class="research-tech-info">
        Neutron scattering is an essential technique used to investigate the structural and magnetic properties of materials at the atomic or molecular level. It involves directing a beam of neutrons at a sample and detecting how these neutrons are scattered. Its effectiveness stems from the neutrons' neutral charge, allowing deep penetration into materials without significant deflection. This characteristic makes it particularly adept at detecting light atoms like hydrogen, often elusive to other methods. Moreover, the magnetic moment of neutrons enables the examination of magnetic structures. Variants of the technique, such as small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and neutron diffraction, cater to different research needs, from studying large structures to detailed atomic arrangements.
