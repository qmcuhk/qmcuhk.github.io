We perform x-ray and neutron scattering/spectroscopy experiments at large scale facilities like synchrotrons and neutron resources to study the static and dynamic properties of crystal lattice, electrons, spins and their interactions in condensed matter systems. We also perform in-house x-ray diffraction and transport measurements.

# Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS)
RIXS employs x-rays that are close to an absorption edge of the sample’s element.  It thus involves an intermediate transition from core levels to the unoccupied valence states. The resonance transition greatly enhances the sensitivity of RIXS to electronic correlations. In a RIXS process, the changes of photons’ energy, momentum, and polarization are transferred to the sample generating various elementary excitations such as phonon, magnon, charge excitations, dd-excitations, and plasmon. RIXS has been rapidly developing over the past decades. For soft-RIXS, the state-of-the-art energy resolution has reached ~40 meV with 1 keV x-rays.
