**<li>PHYS1003A General Physics for Engineers (Term 1)</li>**

This non-calculus-based course covers some essential concepts in mechanics, heat, electricity and magnetism. It is designed for engineering students to get an overview on what physics is about. Selected topics include: Newton's laws of motion, Archimedes' principle, fluid flow, temperature and heat, laws of thermodynamics, electric field and potential, current and circuits, and electromagnetic waves. The course is suitable for Engineering students without HKDSE physics or Combined Science with a physics component, or with permission of instructor. [See Blackboard system for more details and resources].

**<li>PHYS2510D Student Centred Learning I (Term 1)</li>**

The course provides student-centred learning experience in a small-group setting. Students are required to study physics problems on selected topics relevant to introductory physics courses, present the solutions in class, and engage in discussion with classmates and the instructor. Emphasis is put on skills in self-study, problem solving, and especially presentation and communication skills.
