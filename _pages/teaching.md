### &#9632; PHYS1003A General Physics for Engineers (Term 1)

This non-calculus-based course covers some essential concepts in mechanics, heat, and electricity.  It is designed for engineering students to get an overview on what physics is about.  Selected topics include: Newton’s laws of motion including one-dimensional and two-dimensional motions, temperature and heat, laws of thermodynamics, electric field and potential, current and circuits.  The course is suitable for Engineering students without HKDSE physics or Combined Science with a physics component, or with permission of instructor. [See [Blackboard system](https://blackboard.cuhk.edu.hk) for more details and resources].

### &#9632; GEUC4011 Senior Seminar (Term 1)

This is a small-group student-orientated teaching course for the final year students of United College, with teaching staff serving as supervisors, the emphasis will be on student participation. It aims at: (1) arousing the interest of the students in the exploration of current issues and general academic problems; (2) sharpening their research, problem-solving and thesis-writing skills; and (3) enhancing their overall ability in conducting group research projects and seminars requiring collective efforts. [See [Blackboard system](https://blackboard.cuhk.edu.hk) for more details and resources].
#### Class Time: Friday 3:30 pm - 6:15 pm

### &#9632; PHYS2510D Student Centred Learning I (Term 1)

The course provides student-centred learning experience in a small-group setting. Students are required to study physics problems on selected topics relevant to introductory physics courses, present the solutions in class, and engage in discussion with classmates and the instructor. Emphasis is put on skills in self-study, problem solving, and especially presentation and communication skills.
