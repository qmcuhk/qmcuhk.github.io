What is the most important thing in life? For me, it is to stay motivated and to enjoy the freedom to explore solutions for problems of any kind. I navigated my way into condensed matter physics understanding the potential reward is to go on an eternal journey of discovery, else it could just a sad bumpy ride. 

One of my wildest dream, is to work as a producer to produce comedy tv series, or a figure engineerer, or draw manga for a living, or be a professional ballerina, or a professional stand-up comedian, or be a chef for life, cooking chinese food. And I believe being a physicist achieves all that, because I could write jokes in my journals, draw or do simulations, I do clay-like work on samples, I cook with paint and I dance around my critical mistakes. 

Working in physics makes my world so very simple, as if CMP is not complicated enough. I enjoy working under immense stress and tight schedule because I enjoy being on the edge of being fired all day long. Imagine how red my boss's face would look like when he read this.

You know what they call ultra cold atoms? Cryogenics? Uhhhh NOPE. Its so cold because your boss makes jokes you HAD to laugh along, my ass is constantly at 70K by default. The reason why no one works cryogenics, you have to CRY in cryogenics.

You will naturally assume the most important thing to be studied is of the highest proportion, right? Guess what, lets study something that doesnt exist and you cant even measure and regard this with the most trivial name of all: dark matter. You dont even know, the worst part of all, you get to work your ass off for 30 years on something not even terrestrial. THOSE are dreamers, they never stopped dreaming.

Talk about inefficiency, see, theorist students do no work, they hike and they play and they even have the leisure time to play stupid tennis with their STUPID tennis shoes on ON WEEKDAYS, meanwhile we are staying up late and eating our own farts just to stay concious so we could have some progress by the end of the week. Tardiness.

I wish my boss would fire me because i make personelle mistakes all the time. I refuses to answer to stupid emails because people asks for my attention when Im the busiest. I tried to not interact with anyone who tries too hard because they are lame, just like most dorks, sorry, wrong phase, ppl I work with. I work on the weekend in the office because stupid ppl wont stop talking to me and they dont give me no bonus for answering to their stupid ass questions which could be googled in less than two minutes. Oh please, fire me already.
