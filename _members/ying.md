What is the most important thing in life? For me, it is to stay motivated and to enjoy the freedom to explore solutions for problems of any kind. I navigated my way into condensed matter physics understanding the potential reward is to go on an eternal journey of discovery, else it could just a sad bumpy ride. 

One of my wildest dream, is to work as a producer to produce comedy tv series, or a figure engineerer, or draw manga for a living, or be a professional ballerina, or a professional stand-up comedian, or be a chef for life, cooking chinese food. And I believe being a physicist achieves all that, because I could write jokes in my journals, draw or do simulations, I do clay-like work on samples, I cook with paint and I dance around my critical mistakes. 

Working in physics makes my world so very simple, as if CMP is not complicated enough. I enjoy working under immense stress and tight schedule because I enjoy being on the edge of being fired all day long.

You know what they call ultra cold atoms? Cryogenics? Uhhhh NOPE. Its so cold because your boss makes jokes you HAD to laugh along, my ass is constantly at 70K by default. The reason why no one works cryogenics, you have to CRY in cryogenics.

You will naturally assume the most important thing to be studied is of the highest proportion, right? Guess what, lets study something that doesnt exist and you cant even measure and regard this with the most trivial name of all: dark matter. You dont even know, the worst part of all, you get to work your ass off for 30 years on something not even terrestrial. THOSE are dreamers, they never stopped dreaming.

Talk about inefficiency, see, theorist students do no work, they hike and they play and they even have the leisure time to play stupid tennis with their STUPID tennis shoes on ON WEEKDAYS, meanwhile we are staying up late and eating our own farts just to stay concious so we could have some progress by the end of the week. Tardiness.

I wish my boss would fire me because i make personelle mistakes all the time. I refuses to answer to stupid emails because people asks for my attention when Im the busiest. I tried to not interact with anyone who tries too hard because they are lame, just like most dorks, sorry, wrong phase, ppl I work with. I work on the weekend in the office because stupid ppl wont stop talking to me and they dont give me no bonus for answering to their stupid ass questions which could be googled in less than two minutes. Oh please, fire me already.

You see my school so mountainess, I sweat all the time, just to get to the office. And I have to carry my stupid, malfunctioning, dented computer, and loads of tissue to work because crazy ass PhDs will emerge in darkness and use your computer after you leave it unattended. Come on now, someone who stole her lululemon bag please reveal yourself. You say you spend time "investigating through the mystery of the universe"? How about starting your life size investigation by pointing fingers. News flash, pointing fingers is free!!!

You know about the most ridiculous thing ever??? EVERRRR??!?!?!?! The only colleague who I can work with in peace is NOT EVEN in my own group! I will admit im very uptight all the damn time, because I enjoy being annoyed and frustrated, thats why Im so lively and colorful. It is almost IMPOSSIBLE to have a work friend who is also a friend friend. Can you imagine being with a work-friend on the weekend who you try so hard to gauge away from just so you dont smell their awful cigarrette aftertaste? Yeah a hike maybe, because he will probably have to shower after, because of the sweat he had to produce to withstand clean air in his lungs. Imagine going on a trip with your work friend who refuses to work anytime of the day, woweeeewow, he is suddenly alive and want to do sth, NATURE's most precious species, LAZY SAPIENS.

I cant say Im the happiest person, but I spend so little time being sad unless I wanted to, you know the teenager phase you went through just to stream sad songs on loops for 24 hours to keep your mentality an absolute crap just so someone might come say "r you ok?". Yeah I am not those dumb ass attention seekers who walk around all day with their teeniest tiniest stupid ass water bottles just to annoy ppl who sit next to a corridor. They can get water every 5 minutes, I was worried their profession was getting water. And BECAUUUUSE they drink such an amount of water thoughout the day, they get to pee all the damn time. I dont think I am getting any younger, I seriously think my bladder is just no longer elastic and will hold 5 litres of liquid because you bitches occupy the stalls all the damn time.

Xunyang is holding a knife next to my head just to make me leak billion dollar jokes through his damn page. He is adorable but what a psych, i wonder if all good scientist possess the will and motive to MAKE me bitch about every little thing in life.

I think you have to understand charlie and the chocolate factory isnt real, but the dwarfs are. The little snowman dairy products are actually real, why would the chocolate factories produce chocolates that are shaped like little humans and little rabits, its because the manufactuers has to accomplish their lifelong dream to eat humans. Yikes ;D

I am so not a crygenic person because I need no helium to make me cool, im coolness itself.  :D

This is the real life example of how dark and sad the academic world could possibly be, Xunyang just added some emojis and now he gets to be the second author?!?!?!?! (XUn: yes) 

Everyone could be a quantum optics professional, all they do is point laser at the most random things with a cool terminator sunglasses on. I call myself a pro with laser, pointers.

I bet this the closest random thoughts blog to www.creedthoughts.com. 

Let's talk about how insulting it is that your home schools department publishes your big ass face on the internet which is totally violating. They choose to publish the biggest ass ugliest picture that even you will willingly vomit over, to the public, on the internet. The coolest way to die will be to pakour to their office and fart real loud and stink them to death. And you die in eternal embarrassment.
